#This will eventually accept a set and return a boolean value stating if the element is in the set.
# In test_set_membership.py,
# Write a test test_in_set_true
# assertion for an item in the set (expect True)
# Write a test test_in_set_true
# One assertion for an item not in the set (expect False)
# Run the test, see it fail, commit to github
# Write the in_set function.
# Run the test, see it pass, commit to github.
